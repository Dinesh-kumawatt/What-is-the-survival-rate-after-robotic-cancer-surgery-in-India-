# What-is-the-survival-rate-after-robotic-cancer-surgery-in-India- 

Robotic cancer surgery is getting more popular in India and for good reason. It helps doctors remove the tumor very carefully with small cuts, which means less blood loss and faster healing. For some cancers like prostate or early-stage kidney or uterine cancer, the survival rate after robotic surgery is very goodâ€”over 90% in early cases. But it also depend on cancer stage, patient health, and how soon treatment started. So, not same for everyone. Still, compared to old style open surgery, robotic surgery gives better chance of full recovery in many cases.
